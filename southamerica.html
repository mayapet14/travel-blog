            <h3>Macchu Picchu</h3>
                <p>Explore one of the seven wonders of the world. Located high in the beautiful Andes Mountains of Peru, this ancient Incan city is an ancient masterpiece. It is a UNESCO certified landmark, and requires tickets well in advance to get in. </p>
            <h3>Lima</h3>
                <p>A coastal city located next to the Pacific Ocean. Enjoy surfing, exploring colonial architecture, and some of the world's finest cuisine. Cuy is a regional specialty... although strange to a foreigner. If you're an urban art fanatic, you will love this city.</p>

            <img class="backpack" src="images/chile.jpg" alt="chile">
            <h3>Easter Island</h3>
                <p>The land of the mysterious stone heads. Called, moai, these statues have fascinated the world for centuries. Enjoy deep sea diving, hiking, and exploring Rapa Nui culture.</p>
            <h3>Valparaiso</h3>
                <p>Home to Pablo Neruda, this city is bound to inspire the creative mind. Valparaiso is located on the Pacific coast and is the most colorful city in South America. Walking around here is not for the faint of heart. Stairs consume local infrastructure, but some "elevators", called "funiculars", are available for some of the steeper inclines.</p>
        <h2>Argentina</h2>

            <h3>Patagonia</h3>
                <p>Although not strictly limited to Argentina, as some of the mountains pass through Chile, the Argentine Patagonia is a paradise for nature lovers and adventure seekers.
